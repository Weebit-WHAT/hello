# Project Overview

Thank you for installing my mod!
The Haunebu I was a theoratical/purported vehicle made by the Third Reich by the end of WW2, it was to be said to be able to go Mach 2 in horizontal flight and has VTOL capatbilites. Its service role is unspecified but one can assume it is to be used as an interceptor, a schnellbomber, or a zerstorer, even VIP transport. Alas, all this is just a fantasy and no Haunebu ever existed. Truth be told it was just a post-war invention.

NO DEPENDENCIES NEEDED!
