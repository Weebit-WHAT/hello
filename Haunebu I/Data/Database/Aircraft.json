    "Description": "the Haunebu flying saucer is entirely fictional. And not only is it fiction, it's fiction based on further fiction. The shape of the saucer itself is based on George Adamksi's silly flying saucer claims from the 1950's and his hoaxed photos. This was just a GE lamp that he took pictures of off his small telescope which was then debunked a few years after it went viral.

Unfortumately at the end of the day, some people still believed it and now we have a lot of really 'fun' conspiracy videos to watch and trash on.",
    "Tactics": "You can deflect or absorb most bullet bursts and missile hits. Do not run aimlessly toward missile salvos or long gun bursts however, because you might lose some critical panels and lose control in the process. 

Your 'charged weapon' can be very destructive if you manage to concentrate it to a large surface area of the target."
